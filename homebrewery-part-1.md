## Prologue

Welcome to _Wrong Place, Wrong Time_. <br>
_Hail, and well met!_

This crossover adventure draws inspiration from the legendary stories of
**Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser**&mdash;classic swords&amp;sorcery
fantasy&mdash;and from the **Forgotten Realms**, a classic campaign setting
for D&amp;D.
In this crossover, you play well-known characters of **Nehwon** but in
**Faerûn** for an adventure that promises danger, deception, the new and
unexpected.

You are **Gaffard**, a youthful barbarian from the icy wilds of the **Spine of
the World**, and **The Fey Pouncer**, a subtle rogue from the far south, and
adventure together in **Waterdeep**, the _City of Splendors_, strengthening
your bond of friendship while fighting false accusal of foul deeds.

The adventure style is a mixture of "sandbox" and "railroad":
There are plot points where the DM may gently guide you, but you have options,
and those affect where things go.
Don't feel limited!

\page

## Setting

Within **Waterdeep’s** bustling **Dock Ward**, your heroes encounter danger,
intrigue, and reward.

Built atop a vast plateau along the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep is a
bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king.
Waterdhavians live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic,
they rarely miss an opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on
all day and all night.
In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is
power.

Blending classic fantasy with city street gritty noir, you are fast friends
alone in a new, sprawling city, and might encounter fights or opportunities.
You took a small top-floor apartment, shabby and drafty, in the down-at-heel
Dock Ward, many flights up from the street&mdash;but it was cheap and hidden
from prying eyes, official ones at least.

## To the Players

The Dock Ward is well-known as a district in Waterdeep both unsavory and
dangerous. In it you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark, winding alleyways
and all manner of ruffians and ne’er-do-wells. Much of the poor live here,
victims and villains alike. Warehouses, poorhouses and tenements dominate.
The streets are steep and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you know
your way.
Near Snail Street is your shabby 3rd-floor flop on Dust Alley&mdash;a
bolthole good enough for your needs.

After a _long conversation_ with Mrs. Hattrick, your landlady, you
seek relief.
Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a
low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow somewhat illuminating the street.
A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both.

After enjoying _Three Pearls Nightclub_ (and some burlesque),
it is after midnight, and you continue to the Bloody Fist about a block from the
festhall and across Snail Street.
One-Eyed Jukk&mdash;a popular fence for armor and weapons&mdash;hawks his
wares, but even at his "low, low" prices, it is too rich for you.

#### What do you do?

Later still in the small hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto
Snail Street to head back home while pulling up your cloaks against the cold
damp.
A Gnome lad or laddie in rags sits aside the street, eyes you warily, and asks
for "a little coin for my poor mother".
As you regard the seeming vagrant, two hooded figures&mdash;one quite tall,
one quite short&mdash;rush past you down the street toward the docks; their
faces are hidden, but they leave an impression in your mind.
You spot the shorter one tossing something small and dark against a nearby
recessed doorway.

/page

## To the Actor-Manager

You, the DM, are the **actor-manager** &mdash; a role drawn from the stages of
old.
You portray the characters who cross paths with **Gaffard** and **The Fey
Pouncer**, and direct the movement through the Acts.

The plot has multiple points of for players to navigate choices and actions:
what happens next is up to players.
Some the scenes are optional, or alternative to each other &mdash; let the
players guide.
Others are crucial to the plot, and players may need guidance to get back on
track: this is a mixture of _sandbox_ and _railroad_ styles of adventure module.

There are openings and hooks for continuing _Gaffard_ and _The Fey Pouncer_
beyond this adventure, and character interactions with NPCs can set the stage
for those.

## For the Actor-Manager

_Players should not read beyond the earlier pages if they do not wish to spoil
their enjoyment._ 

### Among your many roles

(See [_Dramatis Personae_](#dramatis-personae) above, and further description
and details in Appendix E.)

#### The Landlady

Mrs. Hattrick is annoying, and can be distracting or delaying.
Play her up for comedic effect, but she is also helpful for neighborhood gossip,
information on key NPCs, and helping players learn about Waterdeep.
She knows the Dock Ward like the back of her hand.

#### The Local Fence

One-Eyed Jukk is a connection to the criminal underworld of Waterdeep.
He is discreet but will provide clues to characters at DC 15 for various skill
checks.
He is always happy to conduct trade in weapons and armor at double normal
prices, though his provenance of his wares may be suspect and vary in quality.
He leads a gang of street urchins and orphans, for example, the Gnome beggar
child outside _The Bloody Fist_ acting as eyes and ears.

#### The Beggar Child

Play up the begging Gnome child outside _The Bloody Fist_ as pathetic and
heart-warming for the soft-hearted.
Really they are part of Jukk's network of spies and pickpockets.

#### Minion

A thug disguised by
[Improved Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2881127-improved-disguise-self)
as a tall human male.
You choose the underlying stats, combat style, and tactics:
 - [Bugbear Warrior](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4831002-bugbear-warrior)
   &mdash; focused on strength and melee
 - [Kenku](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195094-kenku) &mdash; focused
   on deception and sneaking
 - [Gazer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560821-gazer) &mdash; focused
   on ranged magic

#### Laeral Silverhand

A _deus ex machina_, players should be strongly discouraged from attempting
to manipulate her or challenging her.
If they try to do so, she'll see what they are up to, and non-fatally
dissuade them.
She recognizes potential in them.
She is a tall, silver-haired woman whose gaze seems to hold both youth and
centuries.
She appears rarely, but when she does, the Watch stands straighter.
Said to walk unseen when it suits her, and to treasure what others might
overlook.

\page

## Act I &mdash; A Night on the Town, or The Catalyst

**Scene 1 &mdash; Midnight on Snail Street**

> It is after midnight, and the streets are slick from the late rain. Gaffard
> and the Fey Pouncer, tipsy and cloaked, leave the Three Pearls nightclub. A
> gnome child in rags asks for coin. Two hooded figures rush past, one tall,
> one short, vanishing into the shadows &mdash; one tosses a dark bundle into a
> recessed doorway.
>
> Suddenly: <br>
> "Don’t go anywhere!" a Watchman’s voice cuts through the wet night.

**Optional Check**: The Fey Pouncer may later use *Keen Mind* to recall their
faces.

**Scene 2 &mdash; Imprisonment**

The characters are quickly surrounded by the City Watch. Combat is hopeless.
They are stripped of gear and tossed into a single jail cell.

> A watchman twirls a large skeleton key just out of reach. "Won’t be needin’
> this anymore."

**Escape Options**:
- *Mage Hand* + *Find Familiar* (recover key)
- *Prestidigitation* + *Keen Mind* (forged key)
- *Strength DC 20* to break door (loud)
- Call for guard: after 2 turns, one appears

**Scene 3 &mdash; Escape**

Gear is stored in an unlocked room.
They may be tempted to steal more (note: doing so affects ending).
A secret passage (DC 15
[Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)
or
[Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills))
leads to the alley behind the jail.
Watch patrols may still be close by.

\page

## Act II &mdash; The Game is Afoot, or The Rising Action

Scenes may occur in any order:

**Scene 1 &mdash; The Street Beggar**

A suspicious gnome in rags (wearing padded armor). Acts cagey. Can be
intimidated (DC 10) into revealing he saw something tossed into a doorway.

**Scene 2 &mdash; The Washerwoman**

The players return to the recessed doorway and find a 1" square of black
oilcloth.
A trail of muddy footprints leads 15 feet south into Shrimp Alley before
vanishing into a puddle.

Knocking on the door reveals a squalid tenement.
Inside is a tired woman, evasive and poor, who eyes the characters with
distrust.

**Scene 3 &mdash; One-Eyed Jukk**

Inside the Bloody Fist, One-Eyed Jukk is asleep and drunk.
If woken, he gives confused and mostly useless answers &mdash; but warns them:

{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
Dock Ward’s not safe: one gang takes your purse, the other your head. <br>
City Watch can be trusted if you bribe the right.
}}

**Scene 4 &mdash; Watch Patrol**

A City Watch patrol passes through nearby streets.
If spotted, the players may be recaptured unless they hide, flee, or disguise
themselves.
Else it is combat, and harder for the PCs to protest innocense later.

**Scene 5 &mdash; The Real Culprits**

The players see the same tall and short figures again, moving through the Dock
Ward.
Fey Pouncer can use *Keen Mind* to confirm they match the ones from earlier.

They overhear:
> What about those two near the Bloody Fist?
> The boss don’t like loose ends.

Combat encounter: **Knickknack** and her **Minion**. The players get
**surprise**.

**Mob Tactics**:
- Try to eliminate witnesses
- Knickknack will flee if things go badly
- The Minion may try to kill Knickknack to silence her, but fails
- Players may recover items, evidence, or interrogate

Among the items found on Knickknack is two sheets of paper.
The first one has instructions, the second one is blank.

If characters take the
*[Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/rules-glossary#StudyAction)*
action ("I inspect the pages", "I hold the pages to light", etc), they notice
a light watermark in the top-right corner of a circle with 10 short
even-spaced lines radiating.

\page

## Act III &mdash; All’s Well That Ends Well, or The Denouement

The outcome depends on the players’ choices &mdash; and whether they stole from the
City Watch.

---

### **Outcome 1 &mdash; Today's Heroes**

If the players:
- Escaped without stealing
- Did not kill any City Watch
- Turn in Knickknack alive
- Present evidence (papers found on Knickknack)

**Laeral Silverhand**, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, appears &mdash; a tall,
robed figure with long silver hair, seeming both young and old.
The guards behave reverently.

She sees the black rock and says:
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
It is Ahghairon’s stone. Yes, just a rock &mdash; but our rock. <br>
We must not forget our origins.
}}

You hand over to Laeral papers found on the bodies.

{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(takes the papers, scans them) <br>
I recognize this work. Hmmm. This first one ... clear enough. Good you found
this. <br>
(pauses) <br>
This second sheet is blank. <br>
(frowns and rubs a silver band on one finger &mdash; a faint shimmer crawls
over the parchment) <br>
I see, disguised, and freshly done so.
}}

DM notes:
-  Ring of Spell Storing – contains Legend Lore

  (each)
- A favor owed by the **City Watch**
- Laeral remembers their faces and deeds

#### Reputation
You are allowed to remain in Waterdeep.

---

### **Outcome 4 &mdash; Fugitives**

If they stole from the City Watch, left behind chaos, or fled combat:

- The pair must **leave Waterdeep**
- If they kept the **black rock**, they may be hunted

They gain no formal reward, but survive &mdash; and live to tell another tale.
You are instructed to leave Waterdeep before two dawns from now, and cause no
further trouble.

#### Reputation
The City Watch (when they remember) look for you.

\page

### Epilogue

Regardless of outcome:

> The next morning, you wake on the road, in an alley, or in a guardhouse...
> changed.

**Both characters reach Level 2.**

Like [Disguise Self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619102-disguise-self),
this spell changes your appearance but not your actual form or statistics.

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can't
appear as a creature of a different size (if you are Medium, for example, you
appear as a Medium creature), but may appear as a member of another species
including forms with a different number or arrangement of limbs as you have.
Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you including being shorter or
taller, lighter or heavier, or radically altering your appearance to seem an
aberration or insect.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass
through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing; similarly an
illusory limb cannot interact with objects or creatures. If your actions or
movement is not consistent with your illusory form, the illusion ends for
those observing you.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the
[Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction)
action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence
([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills))

Mrs. Hattrick is always **checking up on her tenants**, and once a day, she
will remind them about their **rent**.
If rent is **late** for two consecutive days, she becomes **uncooperative**
and may take actions to **pressure** tenants.

**Nosey Neighbor**.
Mrs. Hattrick can be **invasive**, and if the players let their guard down,
she may try to **pry into their affairs**.
She has disadvantage on Charisma checks against those she has already observed
for a prolonged period of time.

## Actions

**A Well-Timed Remark**.
Mrs. Hattrick interrupts a conversation or action
with an **unwanted opinion**, causing a creature within 30 feet of her to make
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature has **disadvantage** on its next D20 Test
for a skill check or against a creature other than Mrs. Hattrick.

**Persistent Questioning**.
Mrs. Hattrick asks a series of **invasive questions**.
One creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or
be **charmed** by her for 1 minute.
While charmed, the creature is compelled to **answer her questions**
truthfully, including questions about personal details.
Once the effect ends, the creature can attempt to deceive her if it wishes.

**Broom (Club)**. _Melee Attack Roll_: +2, reach 5 ft. Hit: 2 (1d4)
Bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

**"A Little Help Never Hurts"**.
If Mrs. Hattrick notices the players struggling or in trouble, she will try to
**offer unsolicited advice** that often doesn't help, but can create
opportunities for **roleplay**.
Once per day, she may provide a small **tidbit of gossip** or helpful
observation that leads to a future plot hook (such as local rumors or a
missing object).

\page

## Personality

**Motivated by Efficiency**.
Always looking to ensure everything is in order, especially when it comes to
**rent payments**.

**Charming**.
While intrusive, Mrs. Hattrick can be surprisingly **charming** when needed,
using her **charm** to get people to open up.

**Unaware**.
Often unaware of how **overbearing** she is; her actions are motivated by
genuine concern but come off as condescending or humorous.

**Nostalgic**.
She often refers to "our departed dear Mr. Hattrick" or discusses events from
decades ago as if you were there to witness them.

## Example interactions

**On Avoidance**.
If the players actively avoid her, she might say:
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(loudly knocking at your door unexpectedly) <br>
Just checking, making sure everything’s alright.
Gracious, my apologies.
Your bedposts are still creaky, it must keep you up at night.
That needs some oiling!
I’ll come back tomorrow around nuncheon.
}}

**Unhelpful gift**.
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
My dears, just leaving a small trinket.
Our sweet Bulima who had this room before you left it behind.
I wonder why she would do that?
Young people these days have no sense, not like in my time.
}}
She leaves a small, unhelpful gift like a stuffed animal or knitted scarf.

**Annoying remarks**.
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(To The Fey Pouncer) <br>
Oh, my dear, I see you're still dressing like a child.
You really should try something more mature... might help you look less
suspicious on our fine streets.
}}
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(To Gafford) <br>
Aren't those boots are too _nice_ for a _city man_ as yourself, don’t you
think?
They'll get **dirty**!
}}

## Notes

**Voice**.
Mrs. Hattrick's voice is **shrill** when discussing **rules** but softens when
offering personal advice.

**Mannerisms**.
She often **fiddles with her glasses** and can be seen **writing notes** in
her book while observing her tenants.

**Quirks**.
She regularly **quotes old folk wisdom** but is often mistaken, leading to
lighthearted and humorous interactions.

(quietly) <br>
Well, it's Milton Cooper, if you must know.

coarse humor.
And, no, I don't serve no "cavier".

# Wrong Place, Wrong Time <br> *(Swords in Faerûn) &mdash; Player Handout*
<!--
NOTES:
- Do not word wrap the title, and keep the 'A' on a separate line:
   - This puts the 'A' in dropcase and wraps the rest of the title around it
   - Breaking the long title line causes format changes when rendered
- Do not break long links: the Homebrewery parser will not understand.

TODO:
- Existing TODO markers in the text.
- Lots and LOTS of reference links to fix like how Homebrew looks in DnDB.
- Redo the Act III outcomes. It's too much repetition to repeat, and there are
  multiple player choices and actions to consider.

## Prologue

Welcome, _Hail, and well met!_

This crossover adventure draws inspiration from the legendary stories of
**Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser**&mdash;classic Swords &amp; Sorcery
fantasy&mdash;and from the **Forgotten Realms**, a classic fantasy setting
for D&amp;D and novels.
In this crossover, you play the well-known characters of **Nehwon** but in
**Faerûn** for an adventure that promises danger, deception, and the new and
unexpected.

You are **Gaffard**, a youthful barbarian from the icy wilds of the **Spine of
the World**, and **The Fey Pouncer**, a subtle rogue from the far south, and
adventuring together in **Waterdeep**, the _City of Splendors_, forging your
bond of friendship while avoiding the City Watch.

The adventure style is a mixture of "sandbox" and "railroad":
There are plot points where the DM may guide you, but _the world is your
mollusc_.
Don't feel limited!

## Setting & Scenario

Within **Waterdeep’s** bustling **Dock Ward**, your heroes encounter danger,
intrigue, and opportunity.
Built atop a vast plateau along the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep is a
bustling, smelly, crafty mercantile city where coin is king.
Waterdhavians live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic,
they rarely miss an opportunity to celebrate&mdash;or at least watch: frequent
inexplicable festivals&mdash;bright, grim, or just confusing&mdash;happen day
or night for no obvious reason.
In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is
power while it lasts.

You found yourself fast friends after a barroom brawl over spilled drinks and
the bill, natural allies by circumstance and inclination.

The _Dock Ward_ is well-known as a district in Waterdeep both unsavory and
dangerous.
In it you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark winding alleyways, and all
manner of ruffians and ne’er-do-wells.
Much of the poor live here, victims and villains alike.
Warehouses, poorhouses, and tenements dominate.
The streets are steep and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you two
know your way.

Near _Snail Street_ is your shabby 3rd-floor flop on _Dust Alley_&mdash;a
bolthole good enough for your needs.
Together you took a top-floor apartment in the down-at-heels _Dock
Ward_&mdash;cheap, drafty, and hidden from official eyes though many flights
up after a night's drinking.

After a _long conversation_ with **Mrs. Hattrick**, your nosey landlady, you
seek relief.
Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a
low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow, dimly illuminating the street.
A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both.

After enjoying _Three Pearls Nightclub_ (and some burlesque), it is after
midnight, and you continue to the _Bloody Fist_ about a block from the
festhall, and across _Snail Street_.
One-Eyed Jukk&mdash;a popular fence for armor and weapons&mdash;hawks his
wares, but even at his "low, cut me own throat" prices, it is too rich for you.

## What do you do?

Later still in the small hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto
_Snail Street_ to head back home while pulling your cloaks tighter against the
cold damp.

{{note
A Gnome urchin in rags sits by the street, eyes you as a mark, and asks for
"a little coin for my poor mother, don't'cha know".
}}

As you regard the seeming vagrant, two hooded figures&mdash;one quite tall,
one quite short&mdash;rush past you down the street toward the docks; their
faces are hidden, but they leave an impression in your mind.
You spot the shorter one tossing something small and dark against a nearby
recessed doorway.

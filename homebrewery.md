> ### Thrilling and Dangerous Two-Player One-shot Adventure for D&D 5e Based on _Fafhrd_ and _The Gray Mouser_ In Three Acts set in Waterdeep, the _City of Splendor_

___

## Introduction for Players

Built atop a vast plateau along the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep is a bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king. Waterdhavians live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely miss an opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and all night. In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is power.

The Dock Ward is well-known as a district in Waterdeep both unsavory and dangerous. In it you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark, winding alleyways and all manner of ruffians and ne’er-do-wells. Much of the poor live here, victims and villains alike. Warehouses, poorhouses and tenements dominate. The streets are steep and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you know your way. Near Snail Street is your shabby 3rd-floor flop on Dust Alley—a bolthole good enough for your needs.

Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow somewhat illuminating the street. A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both. After enjoying Three Pearls Nightclub (and some burlesque), it is after midnight, and you continue to the Bloody Fist about a block from the festhall and across Snail Street. One-Eyed Jukk—a popular fence for armor and weapons—hawks his wares, but even at his “low, low” prices, it is too rich for you.

> #### What do you do?

Later still in the wee hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto Snail Street to head back home while pulling up your cloaks against the cold damp. A Gnome lad or laddie in rags sits aside the street, eyes you warily, and asks for “a little coin for my poor mother”. As you regard the seeming vagrant, two hooded figures—one quite tall, one quite short—rush past you down the street toward the docks; their faces are hidden, but they leave an impression in your mind. You spot the shorter one tossing something small and dark against a nearby recessed doorway.

## To the Actor-Manager

You, the DM, are the **actor-manager** — a role drawn from the stages of old. You portray the characters who cross paths with **Gaffard** and **The Fey Pouncer**, and direct the movement through the Acts.

The plot has multiple points of optionality: what happens next is up to player choices. Many of the scenes are optional, or alternative to each other — let the players guide.

---

## _Dramatis Personae_

### Players
- **Gaffard** — A 1st-level Human Barbarian (Uthgardt Tribe Member), towering and fair, a skald from the _Spine of the World_. Weapons: *Graywand* (longsword), *Heartseeker* (poniard).
- **The Fey Pouncer** — A 1st-level Human Rogue (Urchin), childlike and swift, a former wizard’s apprentice. Weapons: *Scalpel* (rapier), *Cat’s Claw* (main-gauche). Born (he thinks) in far Halagard, in the Shining South, and fled following unfortunate events.

### Actor-Manager
- **City Watch** — The official keepers of the peace in Waterdeep. Uniformed, orderly, and never far away. Blades serve as constables, led by Swords and Swordcaptains. Their tone can vary — some fair, some brusque, but all with authority.
- **Laeral Silverhand** — Open Lord of Waterdeep, spoken of in reverent tones. A tall, silver-haired woman whose gaze seems to hold both youth and centuries. She appears rarely, but when she does, the Watch stands straighter. Said to walk unseen when it suits her, and to treasure what others might overlook.

## For the Actor-Manager

### The Cast yet Unseen (For the Actor-Manager)

- **One-Eyed Jukk** — Rogue fence operating from the Bloody Fist tavern.
- **Knickknack** — Goblin gang leader, clever and conniving.
- **Minion** (choose form) — A thug disguised as a tall human male (bugbear, kenku, or gazer stats) wearing a Hat of Improved Disguise.
- **Others** — Gnome street beggar, washerwoman, Aldym Gedreghost (Fey Pouncer’s late master)

---
## Act I — A Night on the Town, or The Catalyst

> **Scene 1 — Midnight on Snail Street**
> It is after midnight, and the streets are slick from the late rain. Gaffard and the Fey Pouncer, tipsy and cloaked, leave the Three Pearls nightclub. A gnome child in rags asks for coin. Two hooded figures rush past, one tall, one short, vanishing into the shadows — one tosses a dark bundle into a recessed doorway.

Suddenly:
> “Don’t go anywhere!” a Watchman’s voice cuts through the wet night.

**Optional Check**: The Fey Pouncer may later use *Keen Mind* to recall their faces.

> **Scene 2 — Imprisonment**
The characters are quickly surrounded by the City Watch. Combat is hopeless. They are stripped of gear and tossed into a single jail cell.

> A watchman twirls a large skeleton key just out of reach. “Won’t be needin’ this anymore.”

**Escape Options**:
- *Mage Hand* + *Find Familiar* (recover key)
- *Prestidigitation* + *Keen Mind* (forged key)
- *Strength DC 20* to break door (loud)
- Call for guard: after 2 turns, one appears

> **Scene 3 — Escape**
Gear is stored in an unlocked room. They may be tempted to steal more (note: doing so affects ending). A secret passage (DC 15 Investigation or Perception) leads to the alley behind the jail. Watch patrols may still be close by.

---
## Act II — The Game is Afoot, or The Rising Action

Scenes may occur in any order:

**Scene 1 — The Street Beggar**

A suspicious gnome in rags (wearing padded armor). Acts cagey. Can be intimidated (DC 10) into revealing he saw something tossed into a doorway.

**Scene 2 — The Washerwoman**

The players return to the recessed doorway and find a 1" square of black oilcloth. A trail of muddy footprints leads 15 feet south into Shrimp Alley before vanishing into a puddle.

Knocking on the door reveals a squalid tenement. Inside is a tired woman, evasive and poor, who eyes the characters with distrust.

**Scene 3 — One-Eyed Jukk**

Inside the Bloody Fist, One-Eyed Jukk is asleep and drunk. If woken, he gives confused and mostly useless answers — but warns them:

> “Dock Ward’s not safe — one gang takes your purse, the other your head.”

**Scene 4 — Watch Patrol**

A City Watch patrol passes through nearby streets. If spotted, the players may be recaptured unless they hide, flee, or disguise themselves.

**Scene 5 — The Real Culprits**

The players see the same tall and short figures again, moving through the Dock Ward. Fey Pouncer can use *Keen Mind* to confirm they match the ones from earlier.

They overhear:
> “What about those two near the Bloody Fist?”
> “The boss don’t like loose ends.”

Combat encounter: **Knickknack** and her **Minion**. The players get **surprise**.

**Mob Tactics**:
- Try to eliminate witnesses
- Knickknack will flee if things go badly
- The Minion may try to kill Knickknack to silence her, but fails
- Players may recover items, evidence, or interrogate

---
## Act III — All’s Well That Ends Well, or The Denouement

The outcome depends on the players’ choices — and whether they stole from the City Watch.

---

### **Outcome 1 — Heroes of the Hour**

If the players:
- Escaped cleanly without stealing
- Turn in Knickknack alive
- Present evidence (note and Hat of Disguise)

Then:

**Laeral Silverhand**, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, appears — a tall, robed figure with long silver hair, seeming both young and old. The guards behave reverently.

She sees the black rock and says:

> “It is Ahghairon’s stone. Yes, just a rock — but our rock. We must not forget our origins.”

She offers thanks, and:

**Rewards**:
- 100 gp each
- **Tankard of Plenty** (each): fills with rich ale once per day
- A favor owed by the **City Watch**
- Laeral remembers their faces and deeds

---

### **Outcome 2 — Dangerous Men**

Same as above, but Knickknack is dead or the Hat is missing.

Laeral still takes the rock and offers the same coin reward, but with caution.

**Reputation**: They are allowed to remain in Waterdeep but watched.

---

### **Outcome 3 — Fugitives**

If they stole from the City Watch, left behind chaos, or fled combat:

- The pair must **leave Waterdeep**
- If they kept the **Hat of Disguise**, it draws attention
- If they kept the **black rock**, they may be hunted

They gain no formal reward, but survive — and live to tell another tale.

---

### Epilogue

Regardless of outcome:

> The next morning, you wake on the road, in an alley, or in a guardhouse... changed.

**Both characters reach Level 2.**

## Prologue

Welcome to _Wrong Place, Wrong Time_. <br>
_Hail, and well met!_

This crossover adventure draws inspiration from the legendary stories of
**Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser**&mdash;classic swords&amp;sorcery
fantasy&mdash;and from the **Forgotten Realms**, a classic campaign setting
for D&amp;D.
In this crossover, you play well-known characters of **Nehwon** but in
**Faerûn** for an adventure that promises danger, deception, the new and
unexpected.

You are **Gaffard**, a youthful barbarian from the icy wilds of the **Spine of
the World**, and **The Fey Pouncer**, a subtle rogue from the far south, and
adventure together in **Waterdeep**, the _City of Splendors_, strengthening
your bond of friendship while fighting false accusal of foul deeds.

\page

## Setting

Within **Waterdeep’s** bustling **Dock Ward**, your heroes encounter danger,
intrigue, and reward.

Built atop a vast plateau along the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep is a
bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king. Waterdhavians live
life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely miss an
opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and all night.
In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is
power.

Blending classic fantasy with city street gritty noir, you are fast friends
alone in a new, sprawling city, and might encounter fights or opportunities.

## Introduction for Players

The Dock Ward is well-known as a district in Waterdeep both unsavory and
dangerous. In it you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark, winding alleyways
and all manner of ruffians and ne’er-do-wells. Much of the poor live here,
victims and villains alike. Warehouses, poorhouses and tenements dominate. The
streets are steep and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you know your
way. Near Snail Street is your shabby 3rd-floor flop on Dust Alley&mdash;a
bolthole good enough for your needs.

After a _long conversation_ with Mrs. Hattrick, your landlady, you
seek relief.
Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a
low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow somewhat illuminating the street.
A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both. After enjoying Three
Pearls Nightclub (and some burlesque), it is after midnight, and you continue
to the Bloody Fist about a block from the festhall and across Snail Street.
One-Eyed Jukk&mdash;a popular fence for armor and weapons&mdash;hawks his
wares, but even at his “low, low” prices, it is too rich for you.

> #### What do you do?

Later still in the wee hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto Snail
Street to head back home while pulling up your cloaks against the cold damp. A
Gnome lad or laddie in rags sits aside the street, eyes you warily, and asks
for “a little coin for my poor mother”. As you regard the seeming vagrant, two
hooded figures&mdash;one quite tall, one quite short&mdash;rush past you down
the street toward the docks; their faces are hidden, but they leave an
impression in your mind. You spot the shorter one tossing something small and
dark against a nearby recessed doorway.

---

## To the Actor-Manager

You, the DM, are the **actor-manager** &mdash; a role drawn from the stages of
old.
You portray the characters who cross paths with **Gaffard** and **The Fey
Pouncer**, and direct the movement through the Acts.

The plot has multiple points of optionality: what happens next is up to player
choices.
Many of the scenes are optional, or alternative to each other &mdash; let the
players guide.

## For the Actor-Manager

### Among your many roles

- **City Watch**
- **One-Eyed Jukk**
- **Knickknack** &mdash; Goblin gang leader, clever and conniving.
- **Minion** (choose form) &mdash; A thug disguised as a tall human male
  (Bugbear, Kenku, or Gazer stats) wearing a Hat of Improved Disguise.
- **Laeral Silverhand**
- **Others** &mdash; Gnome street beggar, washerwoman, Aldym Gedreghost (Fey
  Pouncer’s late master)

\page

## Act I &mdash; A Night on the Town, or The Catalyst

**Scene 1 &mdash; Midnight on Snail Street**

> It is after midnight, and the streets are slick from the late rain. Gaffard
> and the Fey Pouncer, tipsy and cloaked, leave the Three Pearls nightclub. A
> gnome child in rags asks for coin. Two hooded figures rush past, one tall,
> one short, vanishing into the shadows &mdash; one tosses a dark bundle into a
> recessed doorway.
>
> Suddenly: <br>
> “Don’t go anywhere!” a Watchman’s voice cuts through the wet night.

**Optional Check**: The Fey Pouncer may later use *Keen Mind* to recall their
faces.

**Scene 2 &mdash; Imprisonment**

The characters are quickly surrounded by the City Watch. Combat is hopeless.
They are stripped of gear and tossed into a single jail cell.

> A watchman twirls a large skeleton key just out of reach. “Won’t be needin’
> this anymore.”

**Escape Options**:
- *Mage Hand* + *Find Familiar* (recover key)
- *Prestidigitation* + *Keen Mind* (forged key)
- *Strength DC 20* to break door (loud)
- Call for guard: after 2 turns, one appears

**Scene 3 &mdash; Escape**

Gear is stored in an unlocked room. They may be tempted to steal more (note:
doing so affects ending). A secret passage (DC 15 Investigation or Perception)
leads to the alley behind the jail. Watch patrols may still be close by.

\page

## Act II &mdash; The Game is Afoot, or The Rising Action

Scenes may occur in any order:

**Scene 1 &mdash; The Street Beggar**

A suspicious gnome in rags (wearing padded armor). Acts cagey. Can be
intimidated (DC 10) into revealing he saw something tossed into a doorway.

**Scene 2 &mdash; The Washerwoman**

The players return to the recessed doorway and find a 1" square of black
oilcloth. A trail of muddy footprints leads 15 feet south into Shrimp Alley
before vanishing into a puddle.

Knocking on the door reveals a squalid tenement. Inside is a tired woman,
evasive and poor, who eyes the characters with distrust.

**Scene 3 &mdash; One-Eyed Jukk**

Inside the Bloody Fist, One-Eyed Jukk is asleep and drunk. If woken, he gives
confused and mostly useless answers &mdash; but warns them:

> “Dock Ward’s not safe &mdash; one gang takes your purse, the other your head.”

**Scene 4 &mdash; Watch Patrol**

A City Watch patrol passes through nearby streets. If spotted, the players may
be recaptured unless they hide, flee, or disguise themselves.

**Scene 5 &mdash; The Real Culprits**

The players see the same tall and short figures again, moving through the Dock
Ward. Fey Pouncer can use *Keen Mind* to confirm they match the ones from
earlier.

They overhear:
> “What about those two near the Bloody Fist?” <br>
> “The boss don’t like loose ends.”

Combat encounter: **Knickknack** and her **Minion**. The players get
**surprise**.

**Mob Tactics**:
- Try to eliminate witnesses
- Knickknack will flee if things go badly
- The Minion may try to kill Knickknack to silence her, but fails
- Players may recover items, evidence, or interrogate

\page

## Act III &mdash; All’s Well That Ends Well, or The Denouement

The outcome depends on the players’ choices &mdash; and whether they stole from the
City Watch.

---

### **Outcome 1 &mdash; Heroes of the Hour**

If the players:
- Escaped cleanly without stealing
- Turn in Knickknack alive
- Present evidence (note and Hat of Disguise)

Then:

> **Laeral Silverhand**, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, appears &mdash; a tall, robed
> figure with long silver hair, seeming both young and old. The guards behave
> reverently.
>
> She sees the black rock and says: <br>

> “It is Ahghairon’s stone. Yes, just a rock &mdash; but our rock. We must not
> forget our origins.”

She offers thanks, and:

**Rewards**:
- 100 gp each
- **Tankard of Plenty** (each): fills with rich ale once per day
- A favor owed by the **City Watch**
- Laeral remembers their faces and deeds

---

### **Outcome 2 &mdash; Dangerous Men**

Same as above, but Knickknack is dead or the Hat is missing.

Laeral still takes the rock and offers the same coin reward, but with caution.

**Reputation**: They are allowed to remain in Waterdeep but watched.

---

### **Outcome 3 &mdash; Fugitives**

If they stole from the City Watch, left behind chaos, or fled combat:

- The pair must **leave Waterdeep**
- If they kept the **Hat of Disguise**, it draws attention
- If they kept the **black rock**, they may be hunted

They gain no formal reward, but survive &mdash; and live to tell another tale.

\page

### Epilogue

Regardless of outcome:

> The next morning, you wake on the road, in an alley, or in a guardhouse...
> changed.

**Both characters reach Level 2.**

### Gear

Mrs. Hattrick carries her **notebook**, where she keeps a record of all
tenants’ **rent payments**, and a **small knitting kit** for personal use,
which she’s always fiddling with when she’s idle.

She is often seen with her **Broom**
([https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/5-club](Club)).

### Traits

**Keen Observer**.
Mrs. Hattrick has a **keen eye** for details and can notice discrepancies in
behavior, such as **uneven rent payments** or **suspicious comings and
goings**.
She has advantage on Insight checks to detect **deception** or **suspicious
activity** in her tenants.

**Persistent Reminder**.
Mrs. Hattrick is always **checking up on her tenants**, and once a day, she
will remind them about their **rent**.
If rent is **late** for two consecutive days, she becomes **uncooperative**
and may take actions to **pressure** tenants.

**Nosey Neighbor**.
Mrs. Hattrick can be **invasive**, and if the players let their guard down,
she may try to **pry into their affairs**.
She has disadvantage on Charisma checks against those she has already observed
for a prolonged period of time.

### Actions

**A Well-Timed Remark**.
Mrs. Hattrick interrupts a conversation or action with an **unwanted
opinion**, causing a creature within 30 feet of her to make a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature has **disadvantage** on its next D20 Test
for a skill check or against a creature other than Mrs. Hattrick.

**Persistent Questioning**. Mrs. Hattrick asks a series of **invasive
questions**. One creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma
saving throw or be **charmed** by her for 1 minute. While charmed, the
creature is compelled to **answer her questions** truthfully, including
questions about personal details. Once the effect ends, the creature can
attempt to deceive her if it wishes.

**Broom (Club)**. _Melee Attack Roll_: +2, reach 5 ft. Hit: 2 (1d4)
Bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

**"A Little Help Never Hurts"**.
If Mrs. Hattrick notices the players struggling or in trouble, she will try to
**offer unsolicited advice** that often doesn't help, but can create
opportunities for **roleplay**. Once per day, she may provide a small **tidbit
of gossip** or helpful observation that leads to a future plot hook (such as
local rumors or a missing object).

\page

### Personality

- **Motivated by Efficiency**: Always looking to ensure everything is in
  order, especially when it comes to **rent payments**.
- **Charming**: While intrusive, Mrs. Hattrick can be surprisingly
  **charming** when needed, using her **charm** to get people to open up.
- **Unaware**: Often unaware of how **overbearing** she is; her actions are
  motivated by genuine concern but come off as condescending or humorous.
- **Nostalgic**: She often refers to "our departed dear Mr. Hattrick" or
  discusses events from decades ago as if you were there to witness them.

### Example interactions

- **On Avoidance**: If the players actively avoid her, she might say:
  {{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
  (Knocking at your door unexpectedly) <br>
  Just checking, making sure everything’s alright.
  Gracious, my apologies.
  Your bedposts are still creaky, it must keep you up at night.
  That needs some oiling!
  I’ll come back tomorrow around nuncheon.
  }}

- **Unhelpful gift**:
  {{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
  My dears, just leaving a small trinket.
  Our sweet Bulima who had this room before you left it behind.
  I wonder why she would do that?
  Young people these days have no sense, not like in my time.
  }}

  She leaves a small, unhelpful gift like a stuffed animal or knitted scarf.

- **Annoying remarks**:
  {{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
  (To The Fey Pouncer) <br>
  Oh, my dear, I see you're still dressing like a child.
  You really should try something more mature... might help you look less
  suspicious on our fine streets.
  }}
  {{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
  (To Gafford) <br>
  Aren't those boots are too nice for a city man as yourself, don’t
  you think?
  They'll get dirty!
  }}

### Notes

- **Voice**: Mrs. Hattrick's voice is **shrill** when discussing **rules** but
  softens when offering personal advice.
- **Mannerisms**: She often **fiddles with her glasses** and can be seen
  **writing notes** in her book while observing her tenants.
- **Quirks**: She regularly **quotes old folk wisdom** but is often mistaken,
  leading to lighthearted and humorous interactions.

- **Spell Immunity**: Laeral is immune to any spell that would alter her mind, such as *charm person*, *compulsion*, and *fear* spells.
- **Ley Line Affinity**: When casting a spell that targets a single creature, Laeral can expend 1 spell slot of 3rd level or higher to add an additional 1d6 force damage to the spell's effect.
- **Arcane Reversal**: Once per day, Laeral can **reverse the effects of any spell** cast on her, making the spell’s effect negate or return to its caster.

**Political Influence**. As Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral has influence over all aspects of the city. She can request assistance from any faction or ally within Waterdeep, and she can exert significant sway over the Waterdeep City Watch, Lords' Alliance, and other city institutions.

### Actions

**Multiattack**. Laeral makes three weapon attacks or casts two spells and makes one weapon attack.

**Quarterstaff** (Melee Weapon Attack): +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Mind Control** (Recharge 5-6). Laeral can cast *Dominate Person* at 5th level without expending a spell slot.

**Arcane Overload** (Recharge 5-6). Laeral releases a burst of arcane energy. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage, or half as much on a successful save.

### Reactions

### Legendary Actions
Laeral can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Laeral regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

2. **Move**. Laeral moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
3. **Dispel Magic (Costs 3 Actions)**. Laeral casts *Dispel Magic* on a creature or object within range.

\page

### Personality Traits
- **Just**: Laeral is a firm and fair ruler, upholding the laws of Waterdeep. She is dedicated to ensuring **justice prevails** but also understands when to show mercy.
- **Strategic Thinker**: Laeral is a seasoned politician and tactician, using her **intelligence and wisdom** to navigate complex situations and make **long-term decisions**.
- **Powerful but Reserved**: While Laeral is supremely powerful, she prefers to **manage situations** through **influence** rather than overt displays of magic, making her **deliberate** in her actions.

### Notes for the Actor-Manager (DM)
- **Tone**: Laeral should be **grand**, yet **controlled**, speaking with the weight of her station and the **wisdom of years**. She doesn’t need to raise her voice to command respect.

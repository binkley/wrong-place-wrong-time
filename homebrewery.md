> ### Thrilling and Dangerous Two-Player One-Shot Adventure for D&D 5e Based on _Fafhrd_ and _The Gray Mouser_ In Three Acts Set in Waterdeep, the _City of Splendor_

## Introduction

Welcome to _Wrong Place, Wrong Time_! Hail, and well met.

This adventure draws inspiration from the legendary stories of **Fritz
Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser**, and from the world of _Faerûn_, a
campaign setting for D&amp;D 5e.
You play the roles of **Gaffard**, a youthful barbarian from the icy wilds of
the **Spine of the World**, and **The Fey Pouncer**, a subtle rogue from the
far south, and adventure in **Waterdeep**, the _City of Splendors_.

## Setting

Within **Waterdeep’s** bustling **Dock Ward**, your heroes encounter danger,
intrigue, and reward.

Blending classic fantasy with city street gritty noir, you are fast friends
alone in a new, sprawling city, and might encounter fights or opportunities.

In this crossover, you’re playing as characters well-known in **Nehwon**, the
world of Leiber’s creation, set in **Faerûn** for an adventure that promises
danger, deception, and the new and unexpected.


## Introduction for Players

Built atop a vast plateau along the northern Sword Coast, Waterdeep is a
bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king. Waterdhavians live
life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely miss an
opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and all night.
In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is
power.

The Dock Ward is well-known as a district in Waterdeep both unsavory and
dangerous. In it you find bawdy taverns, shady shops, dark, winding alleyways
and all manner of ruffians and ne’er-do-wells. Much of the poor live here,
victims and villains alike. Warehouses, poorhouses and tenements dominate. The
streets are steep and narrow; signs or guideposts are rare but you know your
way. Near Snail Street is your shabby 3rd-floor flop on Dust Alley&mdash;a bolthole
good enough for your needs.

Everything is muddy or wet from the late afternoon rain, and through clouds a
low, waning, gibbous moon shines pale yellow somewhat illuminating the street.
A good night to spend in a festhall or tavern or both. After enjoying Three
Pearls Nightclub (and some burlesque), it is after midnight, and you continue
to the Bloody Fist about a block from the festhall and across Snail Street.
One-Eyed Jukk&mdash;a popular fence for armor and weapons&mdash;hawks his wares, but even
at his “low, low” prices, it is too rich for you.

> #### What do you do?

Later still in the wee hours, and both a little tipsy, you step out onto Snail
Street to head back home while pulling up your cloaks against the cold damp. A
Gnome lad or laddie in rags sits aside the street, eyes you warily, and asks
for “a little coin for my poor mother”. As you regard the seeming vagrant, two
hooded figures&mdash;one quite tall, one quite short&mdash;rush past you down the street
toward the docks; their faces are hidden, but they leave an impression in your
mind. You spot the shorter one tossing something small and dark against a
nearby recessed doorway.

\page

## Act I &mdash; A Night on the Town, or The Catalyst

**Scene 1 &mdash; Midnight on Snail Street**

> It is after midnight, and the streets are slick from the late rain. Gaffard
> and the Fey Pouncer, tipsy and cloaked, leave the Three Pearls nightclub. A
> gnome child in rags asks for coin. Two hooded figures rush past, one tall,
> one short, vanishing into the shadows &mdash; one tosses a dark bundle into a
> recessed doorway.
>
> Suddenly: <br>
> “Don’t go anywhere!” a Watchman’s voice cuts through the wet night.

**Optional Check**: The Fey Pouncer may later use *Keen Mind* to recall their
faces.

**Scene 2 &mdash; Imprisonment**

The characters are quickly surrounded by the City Watch. Combat is hopeless.
They are stripped of gear and tossed into a single jail cell.

> A watchman twirls a large skeleton key just out of reach. “Won’t be needin’
> this anymore.”

**Escape Options**:
- *Mage Hand* + *Find Familiar* (recover key)
- *Prestidigitation* + *Keen Mind* (forged key)
- *Strength DC 20* to break door (loud)
- Call for guard: after 2 turns, one appears

**Scene 3 &mdash; Escape**

Gear is stored in an unlocked room. They may be tempted to steal more (note:
doing so affects ending). A secret passage (DC 15 Investigation or Perception)
leads to the alley behind the jail. Watch patrols may still be close by.

\page

## Act II &mdash; The Game is Afoot, or The Rising Action

Scenes may occur in any order:

**Scene 1 &mdash; The Street Beggar**

A suspicious gnome in rags (wearing padded armor). Acts cagey. Can be
intimidated (DC 10) into revealing he saw something tossed into a doorway.

**Scene 2 &mdash; The Washerwoman**

The players return to the recessed doorway and find a 1" square of black
oilcloth. A trail of muddy footprints leads 15 feet south into Shrimp Alley
before vanishing into a puddle.

Knocking on the door reveals a squalid tenement. Inside is a tired woman,
evasive and poor, who eyes the characters with distrust.

**Scene 3 &mdash; One-Eyed Jukk**

Inside the Bloody Fist, One-Eyed Jukk is asleep and drunk. If woken, he gives
confused and mostly useless answers &mdash; but warns them:

> “Dock Ward’s not safe &mdash; one gang takes your purse, the other your head.”

**Scene 4 &mdash; Watch Patrol**

A City Watch patrol passes through nearby streets. If spotted, the players may
be recaptured unless they hide, flee, or disguise themselves.

**Scene 5 &mdash; The Real Culprits**

The players see the same tall and short figures again, moving through the Dock
Ward. Fey Pouncer can use *Keen Mind* to confirm they match the ones from
earlier.

They overhear:
> “What about those two near the Bloody Fist?” <br>
> “The boss don’t like loose ends.”

Combat encounter: **Knickknack** and her **Minion**. The players get
**surprise**.

**Mob Tactics**:
- Try to eliminate witnesses
- Knickknack will flee if things go badly
- The Minion may try to kill Knickknack to silence her, but fails
- Players may recover items, evidence, or interrogate

\page

## Act III &mdash; All’s Well That Ends Well, or The Denouement

The outcome depends on the players’ choices &mdash; and whether they stole from the
City Watch.

---

### **Outcome 1 &mdash; Heroes of the Hour**

If the players:
- Escaped cleanly without stealing
- Turn in Knickknack alive
- Present evidence (note and Hat of Disguise)

Then:

> **Laeral Silverhand**, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, appears &mdash; a tall, robed
> figure with long silver hair, seeming both young and old. The guards behave
> reverently.
>
> She sees the black rock and says: <br>

> “It is Ahghairon’s stone. Yes, just a rock &mdash; but our rock. We must not
> forget our origins.”

She offers thanks, and:

**Rewards**:
- 100 gp each
- **Tankard of Plenty** (each): fills with rich ale once per day
- A favor owed by the **City Watch**
- Laeral remembers their faces and deeds

---

### **Outcome 2 &mdash; Dangerous Men**

Same as above, but Knickknack is dead or the Hat is missing.

Laeral still takes the rock and offers the same coin reward, but with caution.

**Reputation**: They are allowed to remain in Waterdeep but watched.

---

### **Outcome 3 &mdash; Fugitives**

If they stole from the City Watch, left behind chaos, or fled combat:

- The pair must **leave Waterdeep**
- If they kept the **Hat of Disguise**, it draws attention
- If they kept the **black rock**, they may be hunted

They gain no formal reward, but survive &mdash; and live to tell another tale.

\page

### Epilogue

Regardless of outcome:

> The next morning, you wake on the road, in an alley, or in a guardhouse...
> changed.

**Both characters reach Level 2.**

### Gear

Mrs. Hattrick carries her **notebook**, where she keeps a record of all
tenants’ **rent payments**, and a **small knitting kit** for personal use,
which she’s always fiddling with when she’s idle.

She is often seen with her **Broom**
([https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/5-club](Club)).

### Traits

**Keen Observer**. Mrs. Hattrick has a **keen eye** for details and can notice
discrepancies in behavior, such as **uneven rent payments** or **suspicious
comings and goings**. She has advantage on Insight checks to detect
**deception** or **suspicious activity** in her tenants.

**Persistent Reminder**. Mrs. Hattrick is always **checking up on her
tenants**, and once a day, she will remind them about their **rent**. If rent
is **late** for two consecutive days, she becomes **uncooperative** and may
take actions to **pressure** tenants.

**Nosey Neighbor**. Mrs. Hattrick can be **invasive**, and if the players let
their guard down, she may try to **pry into their affairs**. She has
disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks against those she has already
observed for a prolonged period of time.

\column

### Actions

**A Well-Timed Remark**. Mrs. Hattrick interrupts a conversation or action
with an **unwanted opinion**, causing a creature within 30 feet of her to make
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has
**disadvantage** on its next check or attack roll against anyone other than
Mrs. Hattrick.

**Persistent Questioning**. Mrs. Hattrick asks a series of **invasive
questions**. One creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma
saving throw or be **charmed** by her for 1 minute. While charmed, the
creature is compelled to **answer her questions** truthfully, including
questions about personal details. Once the effect ends, the creature can
attempt to deceive her if it wishes.

**Broom (Club)**. _Melee Attack Roll_: +2, reach 5 ft. Hit: 2 (1d4)
Bludgeoning damage.

---

### Reactions

**"A Little Help Never Hurts"**.
If Mrs. Hattrick notices the players struggling or in trouble, she will try to
**offer unsolicited advice** that often doesn't help, but can create
opportunities for **roleplay**. Once per day, she may provide a small **tidbit
of gossip** or helpful observation that leads to a future plot hook (such as
local rumors or a missing object).

\page

---

### Personality

- **Motivated by Efficiency**: Always looking to ensure everything is in
  order, especially when it comes to **rent payments**.
- **Charming**: While intrusive, Mrs. Hattrick can be surprisingly
  **charming** when needed, using her **charm** to get people to open up.
- **Unaware**: Often unaware of how **overbearing** she is; her actions are
  motivated by genuine concern but come off as condescending or humorous.
- **Nostalgic**: She often refers to "our departed dear Mr. Hattrick" or
  discusses events from decades ago as if you were there to witness them.

---

### Example interactions

- **On Avoidance**: If the players actively avoid her, she might say:
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(Knocking at your door unexpectedly)  
Just checking, making sure everything’s alright.
Gracious, my apologies.
Your bedposts are still creaky, it must keep you up at night.
That needs some oiling!
I’ll come back tomorrow around nuncheon.
}}

- **Unhelpful gift**:
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
My dears, just leaving a small trinket.
Our sweet Bulima who had this room before you left it behind.
I wonder why she would do that?
Young people these days have no sense, not like in my time.
}}
  
  She leaves a small, unhelpful gift like a stuffed animal or knitted scarf.

- **Annoying remarks**:
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(To The Fey Pouncer)  
Oh, my dear, I see you're still dressing like a child.
You really should try something more mature... might help you look less
suspicious on our fine streets.
}}
{{background-color:#e0e0e0,font-style:italic,padding:10px,border-radius:5px
(To Gafford)  
Aren't those boots are too nice for a city man as yourself, don’t
you think?
They'll get dirty!
}}

---

### Notes

- **Voice**: Mrs. Hattrick's voice is **shrill** when discussing **rules** but
  softens when offering personal advice.
- **Mannerisms**: She often **fiddles with her glasses** and can be seen
  **writing notes** in her book while observing her tenants.
- **Quirks**: She regularly **quotes old folk wisdom** but is often mistaken,
  leading to lighthearted and humorous interactions.

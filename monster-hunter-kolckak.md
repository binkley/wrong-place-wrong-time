### 🎤 Sample Monologue
> *"You ever interview a lich? No? Don’t. They talk circles around you, and if you ask the wrong question... well. That’s what the net is for. And this monocle. And this charm. And — anyway, point is, don't let the coat fool you. I’m not brave. I’m just the one who came back."*
